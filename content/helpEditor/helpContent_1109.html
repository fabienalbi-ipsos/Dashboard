<p>Welcome to BI Business Dashboard</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">This is your guide to working with the BI Business Dashboard. it explains how to navigate, how to export your dashboard, and how to interpret the data.</span><br></p><p><b style="line-height: 1.42857;"><a name="Home">Main Menu</a></b><br></p><ol><li><a href="#Security">Security</a></li><li><a href="#Navigation">Navigation</a></li><li><a href="#Mobile">Mobile devices</a></li><li><a href="#Export">Exporting data</a></li><li>Messages</li><li><a href="#Alerts">Alerts</a></li><li>Understanding the KPIs</li><ol><li><a href="#Headlines">Headlines</a></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><a href="#Client">Client</a></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><a href="#People">People</a></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><a href="#ProfitLoss">Profit &amp; Loss</a></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><a href="#Innovation">Innovation</a>&nbsp;</span><br></li></ol><li>Getting help</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><a name="Security">Security </a></h2><p><a href="#Home">Home / Main Menu</a><b><br></b></p><p><b>Overview</b></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The underlying principle of the BI Business Dashboard is that it is a role based Dashboard with related access, so&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">not all users are eligible to the Business Dashboard; only selected roles.</span></p><p>A list of Roles has been identified, and each role provides a different version of the Dashboard.</p><p>Access is granted based on Tree Nodes in the 3 BI Trees. Access to each tree node will determine the linked report or reports available in each Dashboard â€“ these will be standard &amp; will differ depending on the tree node.</p><p>A role does not correspond only to one tree node but can correspond to multiple ones, but a tree node can only correspond to one role.</p><p>Each user is setup for a defined list of roles and/or associated scopes</p><p>As some users could have multiple roles &amp; scopes associated, a default setup with a default role and a default scope for each role is defined in the user profile table. The default scope is a tree node in one of the three trees.</p><p>The Dashboard is located on a dedicated BI tab: a user on this tab will/can have a different security in default versus the regular BI access on other tabs.</p><p>Some BI automated e-mail alerts are triggered using this same approach.</p><p>Since BI trees are maintained &amp; updated significantly at least once per year, a process of disabling the access to the Dashboard &amp; related alerts is in place to avoid users accessing inaccurate information while the update in is progress</p><p>Login directly to the dashboard is also possible by navigating directly to <a href="http://bidashboard.ipsos.">bidashboard.ipsos.</a></p><p><br></p>

<h2><a name="Navigation">Navigation</a></h2><p><a href="#Home" style="color: rgb(35, 82, 124); text-decoration: underline; outline: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Home / Main Menu</a><br></p><p><img src="&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;http://web1.bidashboard.ipsos/img/help/upload193620161540.png" style="width: 100%;"><br></p><p>There are seven user controls on the BI Business Dashboard. You can change the content of each of these controls by clicking on the control. This will open a menu which allows you to change values.</p><p>Whenever you start the dashboard, default values are populated for each control. This makes it easy to launch the dashboard without the need to make any selections at all, since each control will already contain a value.</p><p>Changing any value in any control will automatically trigger a refresh of the dashboard page; all data on the page will be updated based on the change you made to a control.</p><p>These are the controls available to you</p><ol><li>Role</li><li>Scope</li><li>Year</li><li>Month</li><li>Currency</li><li>Exchange Rate Type</li><li>Rounding&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br></p><p><b>Role</b></p><p>Most users only have one role, so there will likely not be any options available to most users. Your default Role is assigned and saved in your user profile record. You can request to change your default role if you wish. Whenever you start a new session in the Dashboard, the page will load with your default Role. During a session, you can select a different role, if you have multiple roles.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Scope</b></p><p>This control will show one or more trees with all available business units that you can choose. You can select any lower level of a tree, down to the lowest level, which is the Management Business Unit. You cannot select a tree level higher than you have been granted by the security team.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your default Scope has been assigned and saved in your user profile record. You can request a change to your default Scope if you wish.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Whenever you start a new session in the Dashboard, the page will load with your default Scope. During a session, you can select a different Scope by clicking the Scope control. When you log out or close your browser, the next time you log in, you will automatically load the dashboard with your default Scope.</span></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><img src="&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;http://web1.bidashboard.ipsos/img/help/upload193620166963.png" style="width: 299px;"><br></p><p><br></p><p>If your scope includes options on multiple trees, you will see a button for each tree. You can toggle from one tree to another by clicking a tree button.</p><p>You can expand or collapse a tree using the +/- buttons on each tree node.&nbsp;</p><p>Select a tree node by clicking the checkbox next to the tree node name. This will trigger a refresh of the page, and show an updated dashboard for the selected tree node.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Year</b></p><p>The application supplies the default year based on the current audit year. You can change this value to a previous year, but data for the dashboard didn't not start until 2016, so there is no data to report prior to this time.</p><p><b>Month</b></p><p>The application supplies the default month based on where we are in the reporting cycle relative to your current session date. The calendar of reporting period cutoff dates is managed by the Group Controlling Team. Typically the month will change to the next month around the 7th of each month. During a session, you can change the displayed month to any value from Jan to Dec. Next time you log in, the default value will be displayed.</p><p><b>Currency</b></p><p>Your user profile record contains a default reporting currency. You can request a change to the default value if you wish. Your default currency will be used each time you log into the Dashboard. You can select any other available currency during your session. Note that the list of currencies only shows those currencies which are appropriate for you, based on your scope. For example, you cannot select Chilean Pesos if your scope is Public Affairs Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>All users have access to the EURO currency as an option, plus all currencies in your scope.</p><p><b>Exchange Rate Type</b></p><p>The application default Rate Type is Prior Full Year Average. You can select another Rate Type from the Drop down list.</p><p><b>Rounding</b></p><p>The application default rounding option for most users is Thousands. For some users the default rounding option is Millions.&nbsp;</p><p>Millions rounding is the default for users in countries with very small currencies, relative to the EUR, or for users with Global Scope.</p><p><br></p><h2><a name="Export">Exporting Dashboards to other formats</a></h2><h2></h2><p><a href="#Home">Home / Main menu</a></p><p>You can export data into several formats:</p><ul><li>Print to a printer</li><li>PDF</li><li>Excel</li></ul><p>To access the export options, click the Settings menu in the top right corner of your screen</p><p></p><p><img src="&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;http://web1.bidashboard.ipsos/img/help/upload193720169575.png" style="width: 196px;"><br></p><p><br></p><p>Select the option of your choice.</p><p><br></p><h2><a name="Mobile">Mobile Devices</a></h2><p><a href="#Home" style="line-height: 1.42857; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Home / Main Menu</a><br></p><p>To access your dashboard on a mobile device, you must be connected to the Ipsos wireless network.

For example on a phone, not all columns of the P&amp;L are displayed; only the three most relevant columns are shown.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>Also, linked reports are not available on mobile, again due to screen size.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">To take advantage of full functionality, please log in via your laptop.</span><br></p><p><br></p><h2><a name="Headlines">Headlines</a></h2><p><a href="#Home">Home / Main Menu</a></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The Headlines section shows a summary of six key KPI values; each one is a clickable link that takes you directly to the full KPI content further down in the dashboard. On the right, you see the top five proposals won during the displayed month.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">All content is displayed based on the displayed controls at the top of the page.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Top five Proposals won shows the amounts in the displayed currency, rounded to thousands, regardless of the rounding option selected. In other words, if you have chosen to round the dashboard in Millions, the values of the top five proposals won is displayed rounded to thousands. This is done since each row of the data represent a single proposal; rounding to millions would result in very small fractional numbers in most cases.</span></p><p><img src="&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;http://web1.bidashboard.ipsos/img/help/upload193720164669.png" style="width: 100%;"><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br></span></p><p><br></p><h2><a name="Client">Client</a></h2><p><a href="#Home">Home / Main Menu</a></p><p>The client section shows eight KPIs related to your clients.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Pipeline</li><li>Proposal Win Rate</li><li>AOT</li><li>Proposal and Job Compliance</li><li>AOGM %</li><li>Unbilled Revenue</li><li>AR Overdue &gt; 60 days</li><li>CSM</li></ol><p><br></p><h3><u>Pipeline</u></h3><p>Pipeline content is a snapshot, finalized on the last day of the calendar month.&nbsp;</p><p>The section title bar shows the total value of the year to date pipeline, plus a percentage change versus last year to date. &nbsp;</p><p>The details show a table with columns for the Current Year to date, Last Year to Date, and a variance between these two values.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rows:</b></p><p><b>Proposal Count </b>= the quantity of pending proposals in the pipeline</p><p><b>Proposal Value</b> = the value of the pending proposals in the currency selected.</p><p><b>Probability % </b>= the average probability percentage of all proposals in the selected scope</p><p><b>Pipeline Value</b> = Proposal Value multiplied by Probability %</p><p><b>Proposal Average Value</b> = Proposal Value divided by Proposal Count.
